            <h3>SACHIN TENDULKER</h3>
            <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ (About this soundlisten); born 24 April 1973) is a former international cricketer of India who served as captain of the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[6] He is the highest run scorer of all time in international cricket, and the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI cricket, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket.[7] In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.[8][9][10] He is affectionately known as "Little Master" or "Master Blaster".[11][12][13][14]

                Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[15] Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[16] He had previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa.
                
                Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth- and second-highest civilian awards.[17] After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[18][19] He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award.[20][21] He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.[22] In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India.[23] He was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the Indian Air Force.[24] In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia.[25][26]
                
                In 2010, Time magazine included Sachin in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most Influential People in the World".[27] In December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs.[28] He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013[29] and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match, against the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.[30] Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[7]

            <h3>MS DHONI</h3>
            <p>Honorary Lieutenant Colonel (hon. Dr.) Mahendra Singh Dhoni [2] (About this soundpronunciation (help·info) born 7 July 1981), is a former Indian international cricketer who captained the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. MS Dhoni is the only captain in the history of cricket to win all ICC trophies. [3]Under his captaincy, India won the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. A right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in One Day Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective 'finisher' in limited-overs formats.[4][5][6] He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wicket-keeper batsmen and captains in the history of the game.[7] He was also the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODI cricket.[8]

                Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka. He has been the recipient of many awards, including the ICC ODI Player of the Year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007, the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the Padma Bhushan, India's third highest civilian honour, in 2018.[9] Dhoni was named as the captain of the ICC World Test XI in 2009, 2010 and 2013. He has also been selected a record 8 times in ICC World ODI XI teams, 5 times as captain. The Indian Territorial Army conferred the honorary rank of Lieutenant Colonel[10] to Dhoni on 1 November 2011. He is the second Indian cricketer after Kapil Dev to receive this honour.
                
                Dhoni also holds numerous captaincy records such as the most wins by an Indian captain in ODIs and T20Is, and most back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in ODIs. He took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid in 2007 and led the team to its first-ever bilateral ODI series wins in Sri Lanka and New Zealand. In June 2013, when India defeated England in the final of the Champions Trophy in England, Dhoni became the first captain to win all three ICC limited-overs trophies (World Cup, Champions Trophy and the World Twenty20). After taking up the Test captaincy in 2008, he led the team to series wins in New Zealand and the West Indies, and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2008, 2010 and 2013. In 2009, Dhoni also led the Indian team to number one position for the first time in the ICC Test rankings.
                
                In 2013, under Dhoni's captaincy, India became the first team in more than 40 years to whitewash Australia in a Test series. In the Indian Premier League, he captained the Chennai Super Kings to victory at the 2010, 2011 and 2018 seasons, along with wins in the 2010 and 2014 editions of Champions League Twenty20. In 2011, Time magazine included Dhoni in its annual Time 100 list as one of the "Most Influential People in the World."[11] Dhoni holds the post of Vice-President of India Cements Ltd., after resigning from Air India. India Cements is the owner of the Indian Premier League team Chennai Super Kings, and Dhoni has been its captain since the first IPL season.[12][13] He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014.[14]
                
                In 2012, SportsPro rated Dhoni as the sixteenth most marketable athlete in the world.[15] He is the co-owner of Indian Super League team Chennaiyin FC.[16] In June 2015, Forbes ranked Dhoni at 23rd in the list of highest paid athletes in the world, estimating his earnings at US$31 million.[17] In 2016, a biopic M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story was made on his life and his cricket career up to the Indian team's win at the 2011 Cricket World Cup.
                
                Dhoni announced his retirement from international cricket on 15 August 2020.[</p>

                            Cricket is a game of class, character and commitment. It not only requires years of practice but also passion and dedication. Originally played in Britain, this sport has spread worldwide and made a remarkable impact on the lives of people.
                            Professionally, a cricket match consists of two competing teams with their playing eleven. The matches are set in a stadium filled with crowd, commentators, umpires and cameras for their live telecast. There are different formats and championships for the game including:
                            •	Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs) and T20 Internationals which are unlimited, 50 and 20 over matches respectively
                            •	There are many teams from across the continents representing their own country
                            •	Distinguished cricket tournaments include the World Cup played after every 4 years in both 20 and 50 over formats, the Ashes played between the cricket teams of England and Australia, Tri-series played by three nations and the Asia Cup played between India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
                            •	Besides this, every country separately organizes its own premier leagues of 20 overs with players from different nations.
                            Cricket also finds itself in every locality, playground and in the Indian neighborhood. Known as gully cricket. So when Sachin hits a century or India wins the cricket world cup, every individual – be it in the cheering stadiums or from behind their television screens, lives a little more through this blessing called “Cricket
                            2. No Ball- The bowler has to bowl from a fixed distance. The bowler cannot cross the white line on the pitch. If the bowler’s foot crosses the line, the umpire can call it a no-ball. The umpire can even ask the third umpire (the third umpire uses television replays in slow motion from different angles to take a decision) in case he feels the bowler may have crossed the line. A no ball gives he batting team one extra run. Also, the bowler has to bowl that delivery again. In a T20 match, the no ball gives the batting team two runs and a ‘free hit’. A free hit means that on the next delivery, the batsman can only be run out. It means that the batsman can bat ‘freely’ and even if he is bowled out or caught in the outfield, he won’t be declared out. He can only be stumped behind the wickets by the wicket keeper or can be run out by a fielder while attempting to take a run.
                            3. Run Out If a batsman attempts to take a run and the fielder hits the stumps before the batsman crosses the crease, the batsman is adjudge ‘run-out’. He has to leave the ground. The fielder can also throw the ball to the wicket-keeper or some other fielder waiting at the stumps and they can dislodge the bails on the stumps to dismiss the batsman. Batsmen are usually run out while trying to steal quick singles or while trying to convert singles into doubles i.e. two runs instead of one.

                                2.	Bowling, in cricket, is the action of propelling the ball toward the wicket defended by a batter. A player skilled at bowling is called a bowler;[1] a bowler who is also a competent batter is known as an all-rounder. Bowling the ball is distinguished from throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition, which restricts the angle of extension of the elbow.[2] A single act of bowling the ball towards the batsman is called a ball or a delivery. Bowlers bowl deliveries in sets of six, called an over. Once a bowler has bowled an over, a teammate will bowl an over from the other end of the pitch.[3] The Laws of Cricket govern how a ball must be bowled.[4] If a ball is bowled illegally, an umpire will rule it a no-ball.[5] If a ball is bowled too wide of the striker for the batsman to be able to play at it with a proper cricket shot, the bowler's end umpire will rule it a wide.[6]
                                3.	There are different types of bowlers, from fast bowlers, whose primary weapon is pace, through swing and seam bowlers who try to make the ball deviate in its course through the air or when it bounces,[7] to slow bowlers, who will attempt to deceive the batter with a variety of flight and spin. A spin bowler usually delivers the ball quite slowly and puts spin on the ball, causing it to turn at an angle while bouncing off the pitch.[8]
                                4.	A team can be said to have elected to "have a bowl" when it wins the coin toss and chooses to field.[9

                                <p>What is Batting
                                    In cricket, batting is the act or skill of hitting the ball with a bat to score runs and prevent the loss of one's wicket. Any player who is currently batting is denoted as a batsman, batswoman, or batter, regardless of whether batting is their particular area of expertise. Batting players have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in different countries - therefore, as well as having outstanding physical batting skills, top-level batters will have lightning reflexes, excellent decision-making and be good strategists.[2]
                                    During an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch at any time: the one facing the current delivery from the bowler is denoted the striker, while the other is the non-striker. When a batting player is out, they are replaced by a teammate. This continues until the end of the innings, which in most cases is when 10 of the team members are out, whereupon the other team gets a turn to bat.
                                    Batting tactics and strategy vary depending on the type of match being played as well as the current state of play. The main concerns for the batting players are not to lose their wicket and to score as many runs as quickly as possible. These objectives generally conflict – to score quickly, risky shots must be played, increasing the chance that the batting player will be dismissed, while the batting player's safest choice with a careful wicket-guarding stroke may be not to attempt any runs at all. Depending on the situation, batting players may abandon attempts at run-scoring in an effort to preserve their wicket, or may attempt to score runs as quickly as possible with scant concern for the possibility of being dismissed. Unlike various other bat-and-ball sports, cricket batters may hit the ball in any direction to score runs, and have relatively few restrictions overall; this can lead to innovative hitting, such as with the Dilscoop.
                                    As with all other cricket statistics, batting statistics and records are given much attention and provide a measure of a player's effectiveness. The main statistic for batting is a player's batting average. This is calculated by dividing the number of runs they have scored, not by the innings they have played, but by the number of times they have been dismissed.
                                    Sir Donald Bradman set many batting records during his career in the 1930s and 1940s which remain unbeaten, and he is widely regarded as the greatest batter of all time. Bradman achieved a career average of 99.94, while the second best for a completed career is 61.87, by fellow Australian Adam Voges.
                                    Sachin Tendulkar set many modern day batting records included being the first player to score 100 international centuries across all three formats of the game.

                                    <p>. What is ODI 
                                        In an ODI, the two teams bat and bowl only once. The team batting first sets a target and the team batting second has to overhaul the target. Each team is given 50 overs to bat and bowl. Each bowler can bowl a maximum of ten overs. If the bowler crosses the bowling crease drawn on each side of the pitch, it is considered as a no-ball. In case of a no-ball, a free hit is awarded to the batsman where he can only be dismissed through a run out or a stumping.
                                        ODIs usually end with a result unless hit by rain or when play is stopped due to poor light. One Day Internationals see a lot of runs and lot of fun and excitement as players play in colored jerseys and at times the matches are Day-Night or D/N in nature i.e. the match goes on at night with the floodlights on. ODIs are recognized as a revolutionary concept when talking about cricket.

                                        T20 Cricket is one of the shortest and one of the most exciting and thrilling formats of the game of cricket. You must understand this popular format if you wish to learn about cricket. In this format, the two teams are given twenty overs each and the game is on. The team with the higher number of runs towards the end is the winner. One of the most famous and high-action packed T20 cricket tournament in the world is the IPL or the India Premier League which is held in India and sees cricketers from around the world playing against each other for regional teams of India
                                        6.what is test match
                                        
                                        Test cricket is the longest format of the game. Test cricket is played over five days where both the teams bat and bowl twice. It is possible that in a Test cricket match , a team might need to bat only once. But then, it will have to bowl twice.
                                        Test cricket works in a pretty simple way, but things get complicated once a Test cricket match faces twists and turns. Normally, in a Test cricket match, the team batting first tries to score as many runs as possible before it is bowled out or decides to ‘declare’ the innings. The team batting first can declare whenever it wants to, at any score in a Test cricket match. Then, the opposition comes out to bat and tries to overcome the total of the team batting first. If they manage to overhaul the score set by the team batting first, they can continue to play and take what is called a ‘lead’ in a Test cricket match. Once they take a lead, they can either declare whenever they want or continue playing till they are dismissed.
                                        Although, in case the team batting second falls short of the total of the team batting first, then they ‘trail’. If they fall short by ‘x’ runs in a Test match, it is said that the team trails by x runs. If the team trails by 200 or more than 200 runs, then the team batting first can ask the team batting second to follow on i.e. come out to bat again.
                                        For example, if in any Test cricket match between India and Australia, India score 665/6 and declare their innings asking Australia to come out to bat. Australia come out and are dismissed or bowled out for just 365. This means that Australia trails India by 300 runs in the Test cricket match. Now India can either come out to bat and add more runs to the 300 runs or they can ask Australia to ‘follow’ on.
                                        When Australia is following on, they come out to bat and try to get rid of the 300 runs first and then score more runs to set a target for India.
                                        Now if Australia scores, let’s say, 290 or anything short of 300, then India wins the Test cricket match by the margin of runs and an innings. An innings because they didn’t have to bat twice, hence they saved an innings as well.
                                        But if Australia manages to score 301 or more, then India will have to come out and chase the target down in order to win the Test cricket match.
                                        Now one important thing, it is possible that Indian batsmen bat all five days and score some 2000 runs and the Test cricket match will then be a ‘draw’. It is also possible that Australia manage to score more than 665 (say 765) and then dismiss India for just 90 runs and win the match by an innings. It is also possible that we have a proper Test cricket match, where Australia score around 500 and then India comes out to bat and scores some 300 and then Australia try to chase down the target set by India.
